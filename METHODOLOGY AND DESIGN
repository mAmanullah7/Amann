The proposed solar panel cleaning system uses two-step
cleaning techniques. First, an exhaust fan removes dust from
the surface of the panel as much as possible. Four different
types of sands are used here as dust. Then a wiper made of soft
clothes are used to swipe. Therefore, no water is needed for
the system for cleaning. This feature keeps the solar panel safe
from scratch. The proposed solar panel cleaning system is
fabricated with easily accessible components. The prime units
are solar panel, microcontroller (Arduino Uno), metallic dc
gear motor, buck boost converter and motor drive module.
The specifications and motive of some major components
used in the proposed cleaning method are presented in Table
