The proposed solar panel cleaning system is automatic and handmade.
Simple architectural design is seen in this system including solar panel, cleaning shaft. 
A 250W solar panel module is used here which provides an output voltage of 38V (open circuit voltage). 
the output of the solar panel depends on the sunlight. A buck boost converter is used here to keep the output voltage constant.
The output voltage of the converter is set at 12V dc. Therefore,
the variation of the sunlight does not have any effect on the output voltage. 
two reference lines are set for the movement of cleaning shaft/exhaust fan.
Each line consists of 2 motors and wheels. When the sunlight comes out, 
microcontroller and LDR measure the value and the whole system is 
designed in such a way that the system will start its operation at the 
beginning of the day typically between 10-11 am. Every morning, 
the proposed system tracks the sunlight for starting its operation 
even though there are no dust on the panel surface. Therefore, the proposed 
system is effective for any types of dust. Fig. 2 shows the full experimental 
setup of the proposed solar panel cleaner.
