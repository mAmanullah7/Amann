To ensure sustainable environment, solar energy can play
a vital role because it is an enormous, inexhaustible and green
source of energy. Solar energy is directly usable for electrical
power generation for a variety of applications which includes
residential, commercial and industrial uses. It can provide the
necessary amount of electricity without any threat to the
environmental and health issues because no harmful gasses
are emitted at the time of energy conversion. Moreover, the
total sunlight that hits the surface of the earth in an hour and a
half, according to the US department of energy, is adequate to
manage the yearly energy consumption of the whole world. It
is estimated that, the total amount of fossil fuel which is stored
in the earth is equivalent to the energy produced from the
sunshine on earth of around 18 days [1].
In a solar energy system, photovoltaic (PV) solar panel
provides DC electricity from the continuous flow of energy
from the sun. MPPT method based on Fuzzy logic controller
is presented in [2] to produce maximum energy from PV
system. Once the installment of solar panels has been
completed, the fuel is free. The operating cost of the system is
very low when compared to other energy production methods.
However, solar energy is CO2 free renewable energy source,
the routine maintenance of solar panel is required. The
particles of dust on the solar panel come mainly from urban
and industrial products. SiO2, Al2O3, Fe2O3, CaMg(CO3)2,
Ca(OH)2, CaO and CaCO3 are some sorts of dust particles
found on the solar panel [3]. Dust Accumulation on the surface
of solar panel has serious impact on the system’s efficiency. It
is estimated that, about 50% of system’s efficiency can be
reduced and almost 15% power losses can be occurred in dry
areas [4]. Therefore, it is essential to keep solar panel’s surface
clean as much as possible.
Nowadays, different electrostatic cleaning methods and
water-based methods are available and widely used as solar
panel cleaner. A semiautomatic wiper control system-basedcleaning method is presented in [5].
A maximum efficiency of 86.7% is achievable by this cleaning mechanism. Multiple
cleaning systems which include air and water, vibration is
presented in [6] for the harsh desert environment. The output
power of the system is increased by 27% by using a water jet
spray. A self-cleaning method is proposed in [7] which is
automatic. To design the system, a 50 Wp solar panel is used
which can generate 26-50% more electricity with the proposed
cleaning method than a normal solar panel. The whole system
is controlled by a microcontroller. Another wiper control
method-based two steps cleaning system is developed in [8]
where water is first applied on the panel surface and then the
wiper is triggered. The system’s efficiency becomes 17.55%
after cleaning which is quite identical to the average efficiency
of the system before dust accumulation.
Electrostatic dust removal is another type of efficient
method but it is not suitable for pole mounted PV installations.
An electrostatic cleaning equipment is proposed in [9] which
is economical and suitable for the mega solar power plants in
deserts. The proposed system shows better performance when
the dust is less than 5 g/m2
. A self-cleaning method based on electrostatic travelling wave is designed in [10] where the
system consists of transparent dielectric film and parallel
electrodes. With this system, 90% of total dust is cleaned
within 2 mins without any water and moving parts. An
automatic robotic cleaning system is presented in [11] where
a silicon rubber brush is used with an aluminum core to clean
the surface of solar panel. On the other hand, Surface acoustic
wave is utilized in [12] to remove the spoiling particles from
the surface of solar panel. Cleaning effects of surface acoustic
wave are also analyzed in this study where spoiled solar panels
are used.
Another cleaning technique is developed in [13] which is
a transparent super hydrophobic anti-soiling coating on the
solar panels. Multifunctional silica nanoparticles and
polymeric binders are utilized to developed the coatings. This
technique is greatly efficient when the dust particles are less
than 200 nm. Though the anti-coating techniques are cheap
and easy to apply, water is still a big concern here. An
autonomous vacuum cleaning method is designed in [14] with
a combination of robot and docking station. The robot works
on two-stage cleaning mechanism and can be charged
automatically using power from solar panel when needed. An
Arduino based robotic arm is designed in [15] which can
conceptualize a chess board and has the ability of playing
chess.
In this paper, an automatic and economic solar panel
cleaning system is proposed for dust removal. The proposed
system is waterless and works on two steps cleaning
mechanism. Therefore, wastage of water is completely
avoided by this system. Exhaust fan works as an air blower which initially removes the dust from the surface of the solar
panel. Then, a wiper is utilized to swipe the remaining dust on
the surface.
