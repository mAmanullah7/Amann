In today’s times, development of renewable sources of energy has become one greatest global concern. About 80 percent of the global population lives in countries that are net-importers of fossil fuels -- that’s about 6 billion people who are dependent on fossil fuels from other countries, which makes them vulnerable to geopolitical shocks and crises. Along with the ever-increasing demand is the environmentalist concern of pollution that increases simultaneously. A solution to all this mess is the use of non-conventional sources of energy, Solar Energy being one of them.
Solar energy is directly usable for electrical power generation for residential, commercial and industrial uses. According to the US department of energy, the total amount of fossil fuel which is stored in the earth is equivalent to the energy produced from the sunshine on earth of around 18 days.
Solar energy is harnessed using Photovoltaic Solar Cells over which dust accumulates over time, reducing its efficiency and causing power losses of about 15%. Our robot, SOVER, is basically an automatic, waterless and economic solar panel cleaning system, that can help us overcome this problem.
