In this paper, an automatic solar panel cleaning system is proposed and built with easily available components. 
The proposed system is inexpensive and does not require any water to do the cleaning operation. 
Thus, wastage of water is avoided here. And this feauture makes this system applicable in 
the desert areas and where no water source is available. This proposed cleaning system 
is based on two steps mechanisim where exhuast fans do the first part which is remove 
dust from the surface though air blowing. The second part is done by wiper. 
This feature ensure the safety of the panel because any type of scratch is not seen duting the experimental tests.
Experimentally the cleaning system is capable of serving its purpose.
